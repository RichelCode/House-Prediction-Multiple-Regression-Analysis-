## Slide 2: Introduction

- **Objective**: Explore and quantify the key factors influencing house prices in King County, WA.
- **Dataset**: Kaggle's King County housing dataset containing 21,613 observations of real estate transactions.
- **Focus**: Investigate the relationships between house price and predictors such as:
  - Continuous variables: `sqft_living`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`.
  - Categorical variables: `waterfront`, `grade`.

## Slide 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Key Insights:
- **House Price Distribution**: Right-skewed, with most properties priced below $500,000.
- **Price vs. Square Footage**: Positive correlation with variability due to other factors.
- **Waterfront Properties**: Most homes lack waterfront access.
- **Living Area**: Most homes are moderate in size, though a few large properties influence the mean significantly.
- **Geographic Location**: Higher-priced homes are concentrated in specific areas, likely reflecting desirable neighborhoods or proximity to amenities.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(tidyverse)
library(corrplot)

# Load the dataset
kc_house_data <- read.csv("kc_house_data.csv")

# House Price Distribution
p1 <- ggplot(kc_house_data, aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "blue", color = "white") +
  labs(title = "House Price Distribution", x = "Price", y = "Count")

# Price vs Square Footage
p2 <- ggplot(kc_house_data, aes(x = sqft_living, y = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Price vs. Square Footage", x = "Square Footage", y = "Price")

# Waterfront Properties
p3 <- ggplot(kc_house_data, aes(x = as.factor(waterfront))) +
  geom_bar(fill = "purple") +
  labs(title = "Count of Waterfront Properties", x = "Waterfront (1 = Yes, 0 = No)", y = "Count")

# Living Area Distribution
p4 <- ggplot(kc_house_data, aes(x = sqft_living)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "green", color = "white") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Living Area", x = "Living Area (sqft)", y = "Count")

# Geographic Price Distribution
p5 <- ggplot(kc_house_data, aes(x = long, y = lat, color = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_color_viridis_c() +
  labs(title = "Geographic Distribution of House Prices", x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude", color = "Price")

# Combine all plots
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, nrow = 3)
```

## Slide 4: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

### Steps Taken:
1. Handled missing values and outliers.
2. Transformed variables:
    - Log-transformed `price` to address skewness.
    - Binned `yr_built` into decades.
3. Identified influential points using Cook's Distance.

## Slide 5: Regression Modeling and Diagnostics

### Full Model:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
full_model <- lm(log(price) ~ sqft_living + bathrooms + bedrooms + grade + waterfront, data = kc_house_data)
summary(full_model)
```

### Cook's Distance for Outlier Detection:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
cooksd <- cooks.distance(full_model)
plot(cooksd, main = "Cook's Distance", ylab = "Cook's Distance", xlab = "Index")
abline(h = 4 / length(cooksd), col = "red")
```

---

###Slide 5:Box-Cox Transformation

```{r 1.45}
# Perform Box-Cox transformation
boxcox_result <- boxcox(full_model, lambda = seq(-2, 2, by = 0.1))
```

The Box-Cox transformation plot indicates that the optimal $\lambda$ is approximately $0$, aligning with the use of a logarithmic transformation for the response variable (price).

## Slide 7: Conclusions

- Key factors influencing house prices include:
    - Living space (`sqft_living`).
    - Number of bathrooms and bedrooms.
    - Waterfront presence.
    - Overall property grade.

- Limitations:
    - Model assumptions need further validation.
    - High multicollinearity in predictors.
```
